## TodoApp  
A simple Todo application  

## 6/20/23 - Plans  
Starting with a simple WPF-based desktop application.  
Separate UI/Backend so that it can be cross-platform later.  
Focus on clean code and loose coupling - following DRY/SOLID.  

## Goals  
Project will use minimal Nuget packages; initially just Microsoft's DI and Entity Framework.  
Self-contained db  
Logging  
Unit Tests  
Basic CRUD abilities  
Responsive UI
